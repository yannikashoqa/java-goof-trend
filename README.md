## (Protected) Java Goof

A protect by design demo application, initially based on [Ben Hassine](https://github.com/benas/)'s [TodoMVC](https://github.com/benas/todolist-mvc), and protected by Cloud One Application Security. 

The goal of this application is to demonstrate through example how to find, exploit and fix vulnerable Maven packages, while protecting its runtime with Trend Micro's Cloud One Application Security. 

This repo is still incomplete and is meant solely for educational demonstrations.
